# SQL Discussion Questions

### Talk with your table mates and write a few sentences about each question.

1 . When you tweet a tweet, your tweet is available to THE WHOLE INTERNET FOREVER. Why doesn't your tweet disappear after you post it? How does it stay on Twitter and stay associated to ​_your_​ account?

2 . When you enter your debit card into an ATM, how is your account identified? How does the bank associate that card number to your account? How does your bank store your account information? Do you think your address and phone number are stored the same way as your account number and how much money you have?

3 . How does Tinder know you are who you say you are when you open your application, type your password, and begin to swipe insatiably? How does it know that you and your latest match swiped right on each other, and that is wasn't someone other _John/Jane/J. Doe_?

4 . How do you think Yelp can show you all Latin Restaurants, with a $$ price rating, in the Financial District, which have higher than a 3 star rating?

5 . Translate this into your own words:
```sql
SELECT * FROM artists WHERE ArtistName='Kid Cudi'
```

6 . Define "Persistence" in programming. Does the `@@all` class variable we have been using in our code meet all the criteria for "persistence".
